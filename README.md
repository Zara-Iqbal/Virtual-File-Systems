Since the 1960s, Virtual Memory has employed a 4KB page size. In fact, 4KB is still the most frequent page size today. Choosing a page size entails striking a balance between numerous elements. On the one hand, a smaller page reduces fragmentation, freeing up RAM. On the other hand, a larger page will increase TLB coverage; thus eliminating the need to access memory resident page tables. During the years that the 4KB page has been employed, memory size has increased from Megabytes to Gigabytes. We can sacrifice some space for higher performance. 

Choosing the optimal page size for Virtual Memory necessitates taking into account a number of criteria. Internal fragmentation is reduced when page sizes are lower. A larger page, on the other hand, necessitates smaller page tables. The major rationale for preferring a larger page, according to this research, is to enhance the virtual to physical translation speed, i.e. since the size of a TLB is restricted, to facilitate increasing of TLB coverage we have to use larger pages.

Another way of increasing page size and TLB coverage is using superpages. Many machines support several page sizes, which let the OS use several page sizes. In this paper we survey various ways of making the most of superpages. We adopt a simple solution of superpaging with two page sizes. Based on our results, we suggest a base page of 16KB for code or small data segments and a larger page of 256KB for large data segments.
